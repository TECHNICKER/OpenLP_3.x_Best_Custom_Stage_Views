These are custom stage views for OpenLP 3.x (created on version 3.1.7) that build upon the one available through the official docs at: <br />
https://gitlab.com/openlp/wiki/-/wikis/Development/custom_stage.zip .

<ins>This repo so-far contains:</ins> <br />
<b>stage</b>      – a fully responsive lightmode stageview that's been extensively remodeled<br />
<b>stage_dark</b> – the same thing except nicer for the eyes<br />
<b>clock</b>      – a fullscreen responsive lightmode monospace 24h format clock<br />
<b>clock_dark</b> – you know the drill<br />

Use by copying aforementioned folders into your OpenLP _.../data/stages/_ folder.
