These are custom stage views for OpenLP 3.x (created on version 3.1.7) that build upon the one available through the official docs. (https://gitlab.com/openlp/wiki/-/wikis/Development/custom_stage.zip)

This repo so-far contains:
stage      – a fully responsive lightmode stageview that's been extensively remodeled
stage_dark – the same thing except nicer for the eyes
clock      – a fullscreen responsive lightmode monospace 24h format clock
clock_dark – you know the drill

I may be adding more in the future as I go on expanding the church setup.

No attribution required (I'd be surprised If I were eligible for it anyway), modify however you want.
I bear no liability.
